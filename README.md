# play-slick
*Playing with play and slick*

This is a toy project to build a RESTfull API using Play and Slick. I'm learning Scala and this seems to be a good way to do it. The code is definetly not a production quality. It lacks proper error handling, logging, and other things.<br><br>
It most likely not a good example of a proper Scala code, as many things could or should be done differently. It will evolve as I learn more about Scala, Play, and Slick, and have some free time to dedicate to it.
